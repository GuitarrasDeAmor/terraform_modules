# Terraform Modules

[Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)

This is a collection of Terraform modules that I have written.

The naming and tagging conventions will likely differ for environments you work in. 
Unless you want to conform your environment to fix these, instead of sourcing directly 
I would maintain a fork of this repository to fit your needs. This should be enough 
to get you started pretty quickly.
